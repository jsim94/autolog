Upon logging in, the user is shown their profile page where they have a list of their own projects and a link to create a new project. There are also links to show projects that the user is following or to edit their own profile settings.

Other users are also able to post comments to a project to interact as well.

## - What data is being used?

This app uses https://www.carqueryapi.com/ to gain relevant data tied to users' cars for more information and interactivity. It provides more in depth data about the vehicle such as drivetrain specs, etc. Unfortunately this API is quite out of date. Data for years after 2019 is a replica of 2019 data.
